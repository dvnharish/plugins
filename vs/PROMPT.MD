Perfect ✅ — let’s package this fully for you:

1. **Simple Dashboard Mockup (Mermaid flow)**
2. **Cursor AI end-to-end bootstrap prompt**
3. **Usage guide: how to install, run, demo**

# 🔹 1) Mermaid Dashboard Mockup

This shows how DevGuard’s panels and flows connect:

# 🔹 2) Cursor AI End-to-End Prompt

Paste this in **Cursor AI** to scaffold the whole project:

```bash
You are a senior TypeScript + VS Code extension engineer.  
Generate an end-to-end production-ready project called "devguard".

## Monorepo Structure
- packages/extension → VS Code extension client (TypeScript)
- packages/server → LSP server (TypeScript)
- packages/runners → wrappers for SpotBugs, PMD, Checkstyle, Semgrep, gitleaks, OWASP Dependency-Check
- packages/shared → Issue model, SARIF parser, policy evaluator
- tools/cli → devguard-cli (run scans, export Markdown/SARIF)

## Core Requirements
1. TreeView ("DevGuard") in Activity Bar with categories:
   - 🔒 Security
   - 📦 OSS
   - 🔑 Secrets
   - 🔀 Concurrency
   - 🧪 Tests
   - 🎨 Style
   Each shows issue count badge + severity icons.

2. ▶️ Scan Project button:
   - Runs all configured scanners (mock runners first).
   - Groups issues, populates TreeView.
   - Top node: "📊 Readiness Score: X/100".

3. Issue Interactions:
   - Left-click → jump to file + line.
   - Right-click → Explain Issue / Fix with Copilot / Show Diff / Undo.

4. Explain Panel (Webview):
   - Issue metadata, description, remediation, references.
   - Buttons: Fix with Copilot (auto patch), Show Diff, Undo.

5. Copilot Fix Flow:
   - Send structured remediation prompt.
   - Apply patch directly via WorkspaceEdit.
   - Show toast: "✅ Fix applied. [Undo] [Show Diff]".

6. Test Generator:
   - Parse Java classes via JavaParser.
   - Create JUnit5 stubs (AAA pattern).
   - Generate TestDataBuilders.
   - Command: DevGuard: Generate JUnit Tests → write to src/test/java.

7. Reporting:
   - Markdown report with icons & badges.
   - SARIF export for GitHub Code Scanning.

8. Config:
   devguard.config.yml with:
   - copilot.applyFix: auto | preview | ask
   - ui.explainPanel: true/false
   - policy.minScore: 75

9. Packaging:
   - vsce + Open VSX publish workflow.
   - README.md with setup.
   - Demo path: run Scan → Explain Panel → Fix with Copilot → Export Report.

10. Tests:
   - Unit tests with Vitest.
   - e2e tests with vscode-test.

Deliver:
- Monorepo code with TypeScript
- Demo workspace setup
- Sample Java project for demo scans
```

# 🔹 3) Usage Guide & Demo Path

## Installation (Dev)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/devguard
cd devguard
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

## Run Extension

1. Open in **VS Code**.
2. Press `F5` → launches Extension Host.
3. Open any Java project with `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.

## Demo Path (for stakeholders / developers)

1. **Open the DevGuard panel** (left Activity Bar).

   * You’ll see the **📊 Readiness Score** placeholder.

2. **Click ▶️ Scan Project**.

   * Runs mock analyzers → populates Security, OSS, Secrets, etc.

3. **Expand Security → select an issue**.

   * Right-click → “Explain Issue”.
   * Panel opens: shows severity, why it fails, references.

4. **Click Fix with Copilot**.

   * Patch applied directly to code.
   * Toast: “✅ Fix applied. \[Undo] \[Show Diff]”.

5. **Right-click a Service class → Generate JUnit Tests**.

   * Auto-creates test stub in `src/test/java/...`.

6. **Export Report** (Markdown).

   * Produces `devguard-report.md`.
   * Share in PR → shows grouped issues with icons/badges.

---

# ✅ Summary

* **Mermaid Mockup** → visual flow for dashboard.
* **Cursor AI Prompt** → end-to-end repo generation.
* **Usage Guide** → install, run, demo.

This gives you a **ready-to-show demo**: scan → explain → fix → test → report.

👉 Do you also want me to design a **sample demo Java project (with intentional bugs/security issues)** that can be bundled, so DevGuard always has something to showcase during a live demo?
