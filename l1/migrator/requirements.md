# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Converge-to-Elavon Migrator is a VS Code extension that automates the migration of legacy Converge APIs (REST + XML) to modern Elavon APIs (REST + JSON). The plugin scans codebases to identify Converge endpoints, uses AI assistance via GitHub Copilot to rewrite controller/service logic, and provides comprehensive tooling for secure, accurate, and consistent API modernization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to scan my project for Converge API endpoints across multiple programming languages, so that I can identify all code that needs migration to Elavon APIs regardless of the technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user activates the project scan THEN the system SHALL identify all Converge endpoints including `/hosted-payments`, `/Checkout.js`, `/ProcessTransactionOnline` (Credit Card Sale operations), `/batch-processing`, and `/NonElavonCertifiedDevice`
2. WHEN scanning files THEN the system SHALL support JavaScript (.js, .jsx), TypeScript (.ts, .tsx), PHP (.php), Python (.py), Java (.java), C# (.cs), and Ruby (.rb) files
3. WHEN scanning is complete THEN the system SHALL display a list of controllers and services using `ssl_*` fields with language-specific syntax detection
4. WHEN endpoints are found THEN the system SHALL show the file paths, line numbers, programming language, and confidence scores where Converge APIs are used
5. WHEN detecting SSL fields THEN the system SHALL recognize language-specific patterns including PHP variables ($ssl_*), Ruby symbols (:ssl_*), Python dictionaries, Java/C# properties, and JavaScript objects
6. IF no Converge endpoints are found THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no migration candidates were detected

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to securely store my Elavon API credentials, so that I can authenticate with Elavon services without exposing sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters Elavon credentials THEN the system SHALL store `pk_*` and `sk_*` keys using VS Code Secret Storage API
2. WHEN credentials are stored THEN the system SHALL validate the format matches Elavon key patterns
3. WHEN accessing stored credentials THEN the system SHALL retrieve them securely without exposing them in logs or UI
4. WHEN credentials are invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to update them

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view side-by-side documentation for Converge and Elavon APIs, so that I can understand the mapping between old and new endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the documentation panel THEN the system SHALL display Converge XML documentation alongside Elavon JSON documentation
2. WHEN viewing endpoint mappings THEN the system SHALL show the comprehensive field mapping dictionary
3. WHEN selecting a specific endpoint THEN the system SHALL highlight the corresponding Elavon endpoint and field mappings
4. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect the latest OpenAPI specifications for both APIs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate individual Converge endpoints to Elavon using AI assistance, so that I can modernize my code with minimal manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user right-clicks on a Converge endpoint THEN the system SHALL provide a "Migrate to Elavon" context menu option
2. WHEN migration is initiated THEN the system SHALL send the existing Converge code and mapping rules to GitHub/OpenAI Copilot
3. WHEN Copilot responds THEN the system SHALL receive Elavon-compliant JSON code
4. WHEN migration code is generated THEN the system SHALL display a diff preview showing old vs new code
5. WHEN the user accepts the migration THEN the system SHALL update the controller/service code inline
6. WHEN migration is applied THEN the system SHALL support undo/rollback functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate migrated code against Elavon's sandbox environment, so that I can ensure the migration works correctly before deploying to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code migration is complete THEN the system SHALL offer to test against Elavon sandbox API
2. WHEN validation is requested THEN the system SHALL make a test call to `https://uat.api.converge.eu.elavonaws.com`
3. WHEN the sandbox call succeeds THEN the system SHALL display the successful JSON response
4. WHEN the sandbox call fails THEN the system SHALL show error details and suggest corrections
5. IF credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to configure Elavon API keys

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform bulk migration of all Converge endpoints, so that I can modernize my entire codebase efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Migrate All Endpoints" THEN the system SHALL process all identified Converge endpoints sequentially
2. WHEN bulk migration runs THEN the system SHALL show progress for each endpoint being migrated
3. WHEN individual migrations complete THEN the system SHALL allow the user to review and approve each change
4. WHEN bulk migration encounters errors THEN the system SHALL continue with remaining endpoints and report failed migrations
5. WHEN bulk migration completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of successful and failed migrations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the plugin to use a structured mapping dictionary, so that field transformations are consistent and accurate across all migrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing migrations THEN the system SHALL use the comprehensive mapping dictionary for field transformations
2. WHEN mapping fields THEN the system SHALL convert `ssl_*` fields to appropriate Elavon JSON structure, including mapping ProcessTransactionOnline Credit Card Sale operations to Elavon Create Transaction endpoints
3. WHEN encountering unmapped fields THEN the system SHALL flag them for manual review
4. WHEN the mapping dictionary is updated THEN the system SHALL use the latest mappings for subsequent migrations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer working with multiple programming languages, I want comprehensive pattern detection for each supported language, so that Converge integrations are accurately identified regardless of syntax variations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning JavaScript/TypeScript files THEN the system SHALL detect fetch(), axios, XMLHttpRequest, and jQuery AJAX calls to Converge endpoints
2. WHEN scanning PHP files THEN the system SHALL detect curl_setopt(), file_get_contents(), and WordPress wp_remote_* functions with Converge URLs
3. WHEN scanning Python files THEN the system SHALL detect requests library, urllib, and http.client usage with Converge endpoints
4. WHEN scanning Java files THEN the system SHALL detect HttpClient, HttpPost, HttpGet, and URL class usage with Converge APIs
5. WHEN scanning C# files THEN the system SHALL detect HttpClient, WebRequest, RestSharp, and WebClient usage with Converge endpoints
6. WHEN scanning Ruby files THEN the system SHALL detect Net::HTTP, HTTParty, RestClient, Faraday, and open() calls to Converge APIs
7. WHEN detecting SSL fields THEN the system SHALL recognize language-specific syntax including camelCase, quoted strings, array notation, and symbol notation
8. WHEN analyzing code THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores based on pattern strength and supporting evidence

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the plugin to integrate seamlessly with VS Code, so that migration tools are accessible within my existing development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is installed THEN the system SHALL register all necessary VS Code commands and panels
2. WHEN using the plugin THEN the system SHALL provide panels for Scan, Credentials, Documentation, and Migration Suggestions
3. WHEN interacting with code THEN the system SHALL provide context menu options for Converge endpoints
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL use VS Code's native UI components and theming
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display notifications using VS Code's notification system
