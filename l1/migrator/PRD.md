# üìë VS Code Plugin ‚Äì Converge ‚Üí Elavon Migrator (Updated with OpenAPI-based Mapping)

---

## 1. Overview

The plugin automates migration of Converge APIs (XML-based) to Elavon APIs (JSON-based).
It uses **OpenAPI.json specs of both systems** to dynamically generate migration mappings (endpoint-level + field-level), rather than relying on a static `mapping.json`.

---

## 2. Panels

### **Panel 1 ‚Äì Project Scan**

* Scan repo for:

  * Converge endpoints (`/hosted-payments`, `/Checkout.js`, `/ProcessTransactionOnline`, `/batch-processing`).
  * Controller/service classes.
  * `ssl_*` fields.
* Results in **tree view**:

  * Endpoints
  * Controllers/Services
  * Fields
* Inline actions:

  * Right-click ‚Üí ‚ÄúMigrate to Elavon‚Äù
  * CodeLens ‚Üí ‚ÄúMigrate‚Äù above Converge methods

---

### **Panel 2 ‚Äì Credentials Manager**

* **Tree Structure**:

  * **Converge Credentials (Auto-populated)** ‚Üí scanned from configs/properties.
  * **Elavon Credentials (User-entered)** ‚Üí Client ID, Client Secret, Merchant ID.
* Stored securely via VS Code Secret Storage.
* **Play/Test button** ‚Üí calls Elavon Auth API ‚Üí shows response (‚úÖ / ‚ùå).

---

### **Panel 3 ‚Äì Documentation Viewer**

* **Side-by-Side Docs**:

  * **Left:** Converge OpenAPI.json
  * **Right:** Elavon OpenAPI.json
* Interactive features:

  * Highlight equivalent fields (e.g., `ssl_amount` ‚Üî `amount.total`) using dynamic schema comparison.
  * Search field to look up endpoints or attributes.

---

### **Panel 4 ‚Äì Migration Suggestions**

* **Dynamic Mapping Engine**:

  * Parse both OpenAPI specs.
  * Build **mapping dictionary in memory**.
  * Send Converge snippet + dynamic mapping rules ‚Üí Copilot.
* **Workflow**:

  * Diff Preview ‚Üí Inline acceptance/rollback.
  * Bulk Migration ‚Üí Apply across repo.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### **Panel 1 ‚Äì Project Scan**

* FR1.1: Must identify Converge endpoints using regex + OpenAPI.json reference.
* FR1.2: Must display endpoints/controllers/fields in tree view.
* FR1.3: Must enable right-click/CodeLens migration actions.

### **Panel 2 ‚Äì Credentials**

* FR2.1: Auto-populate Converge credentials.
* FR2.2: Allow adding Elavon credentials securely.
* FR2.3: Include ‚ÄúTest‚Äù button ‚Üí call Auth API ‚Üí display success/failure.

### **Panel 3 ‚Äì Documentation**

* FR3.1: Must parse **Converge OpenAPI.json** + **Elavon OpenAPI.json**.
* FR3.2: Show **side-by-side docs** with live schema comparison.
* FR3.3: Must highlight corresponding fields automatically.

### **Panel 4 ‚Äì Migration**

* FR4.1: Must dynamically generate field mappings from OpenAPI schemas.
* FR4.2: Must send Converge code + dynamic mapping rules ‚Üí Copilot.
* FR4.3: Must display diff preview, accept/rollback inline.
* FR4.4: Must support bulk migration.

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** OpenAPI parsing ‚â§ 2s for each spec.
* **Security:** Elavon credentials never stored in plaintext.
* **Extensibility:** Supports new endpoints if OpenAPI.json changes.
* **Reliability:** Mapping engine must gracefully handle unmapped fields (log + highlight).

---

‚úÖ This way, the **OpenAPI.json drives everything** ‚Äî scanning, documentation, mapping, and migration.
No more manual `mapping.json` maintenance.

Do you want me to now **expand this into a task list (Agile Epics ‚Üí Stories ‚Üí Tasks)**, with separate epics for **Scan, Credentials, Docs, Migration** so you can directly load them into JIRA or GitHub Projects?

## 8. Benefits

* **Time Savings:** 70‚Äì80% faster migrations.
* **Accuracy:** Guided by structured mapping JSON.
* **Consistency:** Standardized modernization across teams.
* **Security:** Keys stored safely.
* **AI-Powered:** Copilot accelerates migration, enforces clean code.
* **Future-Proof:** Mapping JSON extendable to new endpoints.
